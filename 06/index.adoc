# Homework 6. RESTfull - Asynchronous operation

## Task

Design and implement simple service for removal of a tour from a database.

DELETE /tour/{id}

Assume that the operation requires confirmation by human. Design and implement the operation in an asynchronous manner. Note: It should not be implemented as synchronous operation! You can simulate the confirmation as a delay of 10s or implement another service to confirm deletion.

## Documentation
Documentation is in Docs/documentation folder. Just open file index.html.

In case a problem occurs, there is also swagger JSON file (RESTfullDocs.json) and also generated PDF (RESTfullDocs.pdf).

## Implementation

Codes of the implementation are in src/ folder.

## Output
cURL example commands are in cURLexample.txt file.
