# Homework 1. Integration Issues - Transformation of formats

## Task

Suppose that a customer of a travel agency submits his booking for a tour as a plain text (e.g. submissions via mail). In order to properly process such input in any system, a machine readable and standardized format is needed.

## Implementation

Everything related to the implementation side of this homework is located in the src/main/java folder.

### xref:01/src/main/java/services/WebApplication.java#[WebApplication.java]

The class has void main, that starts a simple Spring web application and transformation function, that is microservice for input text transformation. 

### xref:01/src/main/java/parser/PersonDetail.java#[PersonDetail.java]

The class that represents individual person details.

### xref:01/src/main/java/parser/TextToJSONParser.java#[TextToJSONParser.java]

The class that implements conversion from entered text to JSON format. The class has methods constructJSON. Method constructJSON builds the JSON string.

## Testing and results
There are some example inputs in the root folder. Output and results are saved as pictures and are saved in /results folder.

Basic test1: Example from courses.fit.cvut (input file: xref:test1.txt#[test1.txt], output file: xref:01/results/test1.png#[test1.png])  

Basic test2: Another example for main functionality testing (input file: xref:/01/test2.txt#[test2.txt], output file: xref:01/results/test2.png#[test2.png])

Basic test3: More than 3 person names testing (input file: xref:01/test3.txt#[test3.txt], output files: xref:01/results/test3a.png#[test3a.png] and xref:01/results/test3b.png#[test3b.png]) 

Basic test4: No person detail testing (input file: xref:01/test4.txt#[test4.txt], output file: xref:01/results/test4.png#[test4.png]) 


Error test1: Wrong data format testing (input file: xref:01/testError1.txt#[testError1.txt], output file: xref:01/results/testError1.png#[testError1.png])
 
Error test2: Empty data testing (input file: xref:01/testError2.txt#[testError2.txt], output file: xref:01/results/testError2.png#[testError2.png])

Error test3: One missing quotation marks testing (input file: xref:01/testError3.txt#[testError3.txt], output file: xref:01/results/testError3.png#[testError3.png])

Error test4: More missing quotation mark stesting  (input file: xref:01/testError4.txt#[testError4.txt], output file: xref:01/results/testError4.png#[testError4.png])
