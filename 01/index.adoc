# Homework 1. Integration Issues - Transformation of formats

## Task

Suppose that a customer of a travel agency submits his booking for a tour as a plain text (e.g. submissions via mail). In order to properly process such input in any system, a machine readable and standardized format is needed.

## Implementation

Everything related to the implementation side of this homework is located in the src/main/java folder.

### src/main/java/services/WebApplication.java 

The class has void main, that starts a simple Spring web application and transformation function, that is microservice for input text transformation. 

### src/main/java/parser/PersonDetail.java

The class that represents individual person details.

### src/main/java/parser/TextToJSONParser.java

The class that implements conversion from entered text to JSON format. The class has methods constructJSON. Method constructJSON builds the JSON string.

## Testing and results
There are some example inputs in the root folder. Output and results are saved as pictures and are saved in /results folder.

Basic test1: Example from courses.fit.cvut (input file: test1.txt, output file: test1.png)  

Basic test2: Another example for main functionality testing (input file: test2.txt, output file: test2.png)

Basic test3: More than 3 person names testing (input file: test3.txt, output files: test3a.png and test3b.png) 

Basic test4: No person detail testing (input file: test4.txt, output file: test4.png) 


Error test1: Wrong data format testing (input file: testError1.txt, output file: testError1.png)
 
Error test2: Empty data testing (input file: testError2.txt, output file: testError2.png) 

Error test3: One missing quotation marks testing (input file: testError3.txt, output file: testError3.png) 

Error test4: More missing quotation mark stesting  (input file: testError4.txt, output file: testError4.png)
